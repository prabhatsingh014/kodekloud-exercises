# Verify the puppetserver and puppet service status on jump host and application server using the command
# # systemctl status puppetserver
# # systemctl status puppet

# There could be an error related to reaching puppet server in the output of puppet service status on the application server
# To resolve the issue, update the /etc/hosts file on jump host and application server to include "puppet" against the jump host entry

# Once /etc/hosts file is updated, restart the puppetserver service on the jump host
# # systemctl restart puppetserver

# Then restart the puppet service on the application server
# # systemctl restart puppet

# On application server, execute the command to apply the puppet manifest
# # puppet agent -tv

# Once done, execute the command to verify if all packages are installed
# # rpm -qa | egrep 'net-tools|unzip'
