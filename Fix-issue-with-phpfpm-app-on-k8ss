# Check what all pods, deployment, services are running on the k8s cluster
# $ kubectl get all

# Check the deployment definition on how it's created
# $ kubectl get deployment <deployment-name> -o yaml

# Check the service definition
# $ kubectl get svc <service-name> -o yaml

# Check the config map 
# $ kubect get cm <configmap-name> -o yaml

# Once you try to access the nodeport <30008>, it shows error bad gateway

# On analysing, it is found out that the issue is happening because of two issues
# a. In service definition, targetPort is not correct
# b. In configmap definition, index.php is either not correct or not defined at all

# Correct the targetPort in service object using the command
# $ kubectl edit svc <service-name>

# Correct the index.php file name in the configmap using the command
# $ kubectl edit cm <configmap-name>

# Once both are corrected, delete the existing pod. A new pod will automatically be created as it's part of a replica
# $ kubectl delete pod <pod-name>

# Copy the index.php file from the host to the container as asked in the question
# $ kubectl cp /tmp/index.php <pod-name>:/var/www/html -c nginx-container

# You should now be able to access the page at the nodePort 30008
